# amazon_clone
In this project, I am developing an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS. This project aims to replicate the home page and design elements of the Amazon website, focusing on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Key Features:
Home Page: Includes a responsive navbar with categories, a search bar, and a user account section. The main content features promotional banners, my cart and return and orders.Hover effects enhance the user experience.
Product Listings: Display products in a grid layout with images, titles. 
Responsive Design: Ensures the site looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Footer: Includes un-active link to different sections like customer service, company info.
This project will enhance my skills in HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a clean, modern, and responsive web design.
